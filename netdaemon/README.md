# NetDaemon

This is the application daemon project for Home Assistant. This project makes it possible to make automations using the .NET Core (3.1) framework.

Why a new application daemon for Home Assistant? There already exists one!? The existing appdaemon is a great software and are using python as language and ecosystem. This is for people who loves to code in the .NET core ecosystem and c#. The daemon will be supported by all supported platforms of .NET core.

## Pre-Alpha! Expect things to change!

This is in pre-alpha experimental phase and expect API:s to change over time. Please use and contribute ideas for improvement or better yet PR:s.

Only amd64 (non arm) is currently supported but ARM devices as Raspberry PI will be supported in the near future.

The daemon is currently only distributed through Hassio add-on but a docker container and instruction to run locally will be provided in time.
